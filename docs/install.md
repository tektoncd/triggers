# Setting Up Tekton Triggers

Follow the steps below to set up an official release of Tekton Triggers on your Kubernetes cluster.
If you want to test Triggers from `HEAD`, see the
[Tekton Developer Guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md#install-triggers).

## Prerequisites

You must satisfy the following prerequisites to set up Tekton Triggers:

* You must have a Kubernetes Cluster running Kubernetes 1.18 or above.

  You can use [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to quickly create a local cluster with RBAC enabled for testing purposes:

  * Install `kind` as described in [Installation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).

  * Create a cluster as described in [Creating a Cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster).

* You must have Tekton Pipelines installed on your Kubernetes cluster.

  For instructions, see [Installing Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md).

* You must grant the `cluster-admin` privilege to the user with which you installed Tekton Pipelines.

  For instructions, see [Role-based access control](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#prerequisites_for_using_role-based_access_control).

## Installing Tekton Triggers on Your Cluster

1. Log on to your Kubernetes cluster as the user with which you installed Tekton Pipelines.

1.  Use the [`kubectl apply`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command to install the latest release of Tekton Triggers and its dependencies:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml
    kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/interceptors.yaml
    ```

    To install a specific release of Tekton Triggers, replace `latest` with the desired version number as shown in the following example:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/previous/v0.1.0/release.yaml
    ```

    To install a nightly release, use the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases-nightly/triggers/latest/release.yaml
    ```

1.  Monitor the installation using the [`kubectl get`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)
    command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines --watch
    ```

1. When all Tekton Triggers components report a status of `Running` press CTRL+C to stop monitoring.

You are now ready to configure Tekton Triggers for your workflow. For instructions, see the following:

- [Tekton Triggers Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/)
- [Tekton Triggers code examples](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/tree/main/examples)

## Customizing the Triggers Controller behavior

To customize the behavior of the Triggers Controller, modify the ConfigMap `feature-flags-triggers` as follows:

- `enable-api-fields`: set this flag to "stable" to allow only the
most stable features to be used. Set it to "alpha" to allow alpha
features (in addition to stable features) to be used. Note that this flag only applies to the v1beta1 apiVersion.

- `labels-exclusion-pattern`: set this field with regex pattern which will 
exclude labels matching the pattern from getting added to resources created 
by the EventListener such as the deployment. By default, there is no value is set
for this field so all labels added to the EventListener are propagated down.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: feature-flags-triggers
data:
  enable-api-fields: "alpha" # Allow "alpha" fields to be used in v1beta1 Triggers' resources. Defaults to "stable" features only.
  labels-exclusion-pattern: "^tekton-dev-"
```
