# Tekton Triggers Releases

## Release Frequency

Tekton Triggers follows the Tekton community [release policy][release-policy]
as follows:

- Versions are numbered according to semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
- A new release is produced on a monthly basis, when enough content is available
- Four releases a year are chosen for [long term support (LTS)](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/releases.md#support-policy).
  All remaining releases are supported for approximately 1 month (until the next
  release is produced)
    - LTS releases take place in January, April, July and October every year
    - The first Tekton Triggers LTS release will be **v0.22.0** in October 2022
    - Releases usually happen towards the middle of the month, but the exact date
      may vary, depending on week-ends and readiness

Tekton Triggers produces nightly builds, publicly available on
`gcr.io/tekton-nightly`. 

### Transition Process

Before release v0.22 Tekton Triggers has worked on the basis of an undocumented
support period of four months, which will be maintained for the release v0.21.

## Release Process

Tekton Triggers releases are made of YAML manifests and container images.
Manifests are published to cloud object-storage as well as
[GitHub][tekton-triggers-releases]. Container images are signed by
[Sigstore][sigstore] via [Tekton Chains][tekton-chains]; signatures can be
verified through the [public key][chains-public-key] hosted by the Tekton Chains
project.
