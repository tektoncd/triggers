"""
koparse.py parses release.yaml files from `ko`

The `ko` tool (https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/master/cmd/ko)
builds images and embeds the full names of the built images in the resulting
yaml files.

This script does two things:

* Parses those image names out of the release.yaml, including their digests, and
  outputs those to stdout
* Verifies the list of built images against an expected list, to be sure that all
  expected images were built (and no extra images were built)
