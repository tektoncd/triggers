# Triggers Examples


This folder contains a number of examples of running Triggers with various confifurations. Each sub-folder has a 
README.md explaining how to run each example.

**Note**: All of the examples use Tekton Pipeline resources, so make sure you've [installed](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md) that first!
