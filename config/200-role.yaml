# NOTE:  when multi-tenant EventListener progresses, moving this Role
# to a ClusterRole is not the advisable path.  Additional Roles that
# adds access to Secrets to the Namespaces managed by the multi-tenant
# EventListener is what should be done.  While not as simple, it avoids
# giving access to K8S system level, cluster admin privileged level Secrets
