# Tekton Triggers
Triggers is a Kubernetes [Custom Resource Defintion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRD) controller that allows you to extract information from events payloads (a "trigger") to create Kubernetes resources. 

ðŸš¨ The contents of this repo are currently a WIP ðŸš¨ We are working toward implementing
[this design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fngeNn3kGD4P_FTZjAnfERcEajS7zQhSEUaN7BYIlTw/edit#heading=h.iyqzt1brkg3o)
(visible to members of [the Tekton mailing list](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/contact.md#mailing-list)).

## Background
[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) is a **Kubernetes-native**, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) framework that enables you to create containerized, composable, and configurable workloads declaratively through CRDs. Naturally, CI/CD events contain information that should:
- Identify the kind of event (Github Push, Gitlab Issue, Docker Hub Webhook, etc.)
- Be accessible from and map to particular pipelines (Take SHA from payload to use it in pipeline X)
- Deterministically trigger pipelines (Events/pipelines that trigger pipelines based on certain payload values)

Tekton API Tasks and Pipelines are reusable, but Tekton does not provide a mechanism to generate key resources such as [PipelineRuns](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md) and [PipelineResources](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md#pipelineresources) to dynamically execute additional Tasks or generate additional outputs/inputs to future Tasks and Pipelines. Triggers extends the Tekton architecture with the following CRDs for generating Kubernetes resources:

- 'Trigger' - Instantiates resources such as Tekton's PipelineResources, PipelineRuns, or any generic Kubernetes resource
- `EventListener` - Wraps Trigger(s) into an addressable endpoint (the event sink), and effectively supplies runtime values necessary for a given Trigger


Prior to an listened-for event occuring, all variables are set for a given Trigger except a few ConfigMaps, Secrets, or environment variables that will need provided at runtime when a Trigger CRD is generated through the EventListener. A Trigger CRD is generated when an event being listened for happens, and represents that there was an instance of the listened-for event as well as a concrete set of resources the controller will take in response to that event.

Using `tektoncd/triggers` in conjunction with `tektoncd/pipeline` enables you to easily create full-fledged CI/CD systems where the execution is defined **entirely** through Kubernetes resources. This repo draws inspiration from `Tekton`, but can used stand alone since `Trigger` can create any Kubernetes resource.

## Want to start using Tekton Triggers

It is never too early, though Triggers is pre-alpha currently! In the meantime, consider
