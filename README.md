Tekton Triggers is a Kubernetes
[Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
(CRD) controller that allows you to create Kubernetes resources based on information it extracts from event payloads.

 Tekton Triggers originates from the implementation of [this design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fngeNn3kGD4P_FTZjAnfERcEajS7zQhSEUaN7BYIlTw/edit#heading=h.iyqzt1brkg3o)
(visible to members of [the Tekton mailing list](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/contact.md#mailing-list)).

## Background

[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) is a Kubernetes-native continuous integration and delivery
(CI/CD) framework that allows you to create containerized, composable, and configurable workloads declaratively
through Kubernetes CRDs. When integrated with Tekton Triggers, Tekton allows you to easily create fully fledged CI/CD systems in which you
define all mechanics exclusively using Kubernetes resources.

To learn more, see the [Tekton Triggers Overview](docs/README.md).
