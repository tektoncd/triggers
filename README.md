# Tekton Triggers
Triggers is a Kubernetes [Custom Resource Defintion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRD) controller that allows you to extract information from events payloads (a "trigger") to create Kubernetes resources.

The contents of this repo originated from implementing [this design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fngeNn3kGD4P_FTZjAnfERcEajS7zQhSEUaN7BYIlTw/edit#heading=h.iyqzt1brkg3o)
(visible to members of [the Tekton mailing list](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/contact.md#mailing-list)).

## Background
[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) is a **Kubernetes-native**, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) framework that enables you to create containerized, composable, and configurable workloads declaratively through CRDs.
Naturally, CI/CD events contain information that should:
- Identify the kind of event (GitHub Push, Gitlab Issue, Docker Hub Webhook, etc.)
- Be accessible from and map to particular pipelines (Take SHA from payload to use it in pipeline X)
- Deterministically trigger pipelines (Events/pipelines that trigger pipelines based on certain payload values)

The Tekton API enables functionality to be seperated from configuration (e.g. [Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelines.md) vs [PipelineRuns](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md)) such that steps can be reusable, but it does not provide a mechanism to generate the resources (notably, [PipelineRuns](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md) and [PipelineResources](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md#pipelineresources)) that encapsulate these configurations dynamically. Triggers extends the Tekton architecture with the following CRDs:
- [`TriggerTemplate`](docs/triggertemplates.md) - Templates resources to be created (e.g. Create PipelineResources and PipelineRun that uses them)
- [`TriggerBinding`](docs/triggerbindings.md) - Validates events and extracts payload fields
- [`EventListener`](docs/eventlisteners.md) - Connects `TriggerBindings` and `TriggerTemplates` into an [addressable](https://github.com/knative/eventing/blob/master/docs/spec/interfaces.md) endpoint (the event sink). It uses the extracted event parameters from each `TriggerBinding` (and any supplied static parameters) to create the resources specified in the corresponding `TriggerTemplate`. It also optionally allows an external service to pre-process the event payload via the `interceptor` field.


Using `tektoncd/triggers` in conjunction with `tektoncd/pipeline` enables you to easily create full-fledged CI/CD systems where the execution is defined **entirely** through Kubernetes resources.
This repo draws inspiration from `Tekton`, but can used stand alone since `TriggerTemplates` can create any Kubernetes resource.

## Want to start using Tekton Triggers

[Install](./docs/install.md) Triggers, check out the [installation guide](./docs/install.md),  [examples](./examples/README.md) or follow the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started/README.md) to become familiar with the project. The getting started guide walks through setting up an end-to-end image building solution, which will be triggered from GitHub `push` events.
