# Release Notes

<!--
Describe any user facing changes here, or delete this block.

Examples of user facing changes:
- API changes
- Bug fixes
- Any changes in behavior
- Changes requiring upgrade notices or deprecation warnings

For pull requests with a release note:

```release-note
Your release note here
```

For pull requests that require additional action from users switching to the new release, include the string "action required" (case insensitive) in the release note:

```release-note
action required: your release note here
```

For pull requests that don't need to be mentioned at release time, use the `/release-note-none` Prow command to add the `release-note-none` label to the PR. You can also write the string "NONE" as a release note in your PR description:

```release-note
NONE
```
